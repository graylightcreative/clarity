The Mentor

The VST3 plugin itself. It acts as a teacher, not a processor.

General

Satellite

An individual instance of the plugin loaded on a single track. It analyzes local audio and reports to the Hive Mind.

Architecture

Hive Mind

The SessionManager Singleton. It holds the global state of the mix and allows Satellites to "see" each other.

C++ / Logic

Accumulator

The mixing workflow logic. It enforces a hierarchy (Drums -> Bass -> Guitars -> Vocals) to ensure tracks are mixed in context.

Logic

Wake-on-Edit

A state trigger. When a user opens the plugin window, the instance wakes up from "Sleep Mode" and re-scans the audio for 3-5 seconds.

Optimization

Fingerprint

A lightweight data structure (struct) containing the spectral analysis and dynamic profile of a track. Used to save RAM.

Data

2. AI & Data Terms

Term

Definition

Context

Contrast Training

Our ML strategy. We train the model by showing it pairs of "Good" (Ideal) and "Bad" (Flawed) audio generated by Suno AI.

Python / Training

TinyML

The practice of running machine learning models locally on edge devices (or in our case, inside a VST) without cloud API calls.

AI Strategy

ONNX

Open Neural Network Exchange. The file format (.onnx) used to move our trained brain from Python to C++.

Tech Stack

Target Profile

The "Ideal" set of data points (EQ curve, Attack time) for a specific instrument and genre (e.g., "Metalcore Kick").

Knowledge Base

3. UX/UI Terms

Term

Definition

Context

Ghost Needle

A visual overlay on the Gain Reduction meter. It shows the user exactly where the needle should be bouncing to achieve the target sound.

UI Design

The Feed

The text-based priority list of instructions (e.g., "Cut 200Hz").

UI Design

The Map

The lookup table that translates abstract AI values (0.0 - 1.0) into specific Studio One plugin parameters.

Knowledge Base

Validation

The "Green Checkmark" moment. When the plugin detects the user has successfully followed an instruction.

UX Loop

4. Audio Processing Terms

Term

Definition

Context

Masking

When one instrument (e.g., Bass) hides the frequencies of another (e.g., Kick). The Hive Mind detects this by comparing Fingerprints.

DSP

Transient

The initial high-energy "crack" of a sound. Critical for Drum analysis.

DSP

LUFS

Loudness Units Full Scale. The standard unit for measuring average loudness over time.

DSP

Spectrogram

A visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time.
